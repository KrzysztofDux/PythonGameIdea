# PythonGameIdea
Simple text RPG engine that could probably be later easily extended to handle more complicated mechanics or different interface.

To start just open terminal in the catalog and run 
```sh
python app.py
```

For now it's just a silly idea developed over a few hours. But it ["just works"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPN0qhSyWy8&ab_channel=TheChalkeaters), just like Bethesda's engine.

Important things to consider:
  - Handling actions feedback in organised way.
  - Attaching contextual actions to characters in the location.
